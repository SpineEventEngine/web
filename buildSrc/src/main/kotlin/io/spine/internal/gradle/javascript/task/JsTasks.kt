/**
 * A scope for setting up JavaScript-related tasks.
 *
 * The scope provides:
 *
 *  1. Access to the current [JsContext];
 *  2. Project's [TaskContainer];
 *  3. Default task groups.
 *
 * Supposing, one needs to create a new task that would participate in building. Let task name be
 * `bundleJs`. To achieve the objection, several steps are to be performed:
 *
 *  1. Define the task as an extension function upon `JsTaskRegistering` scope;
 *  2. Create typed reference for the task upon [TaskContainer]. It would facilitate referencing
 *     to the new task. For example, to add external dependents;
 *  3. Call the resulted extension from `build.gradle.kts`.
 *
 * Here's an example of `bundleJs()` extension:
 *
 * ```
 * import org.gradle.api.Task
 * import org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskContainer
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * val TaskContainer.bundleJs: Task
 *     get() = getByName("bundleJs")
 *
 * fun JsTasks.bundleJs() =
 *     register("bundleJs) {
 *
 *         description = "Bundles js sources using `webpack` tool.`
 *         group = jsBuildTask
 *
 *         doLast {
 *             npm("run", "build")
 *             npm("run", "build-dev")
 *         }
 *
 *         buildJs.dependsOn(this)
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * And how to apply it in `build.gradle.kts`:
 *
 * ```
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.js.javascript
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.js.task.buildJs
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * javascript {
 *     tasks {
 *         bundleJs()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Declaring typed references upon [TaskContainer] is optional. But it is highly encouraged
 * to reference other tasks by such extensions instead of hard-typed string values.
