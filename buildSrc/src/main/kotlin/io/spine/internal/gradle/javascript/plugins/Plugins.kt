/**
 * A scope for applying and configuring of JavaScript-related plugins.
 *
 * The scope extends [JsContext] and provides access to the project's [TaskContainer].
 *
 * Supposing, one needs to apply and configure `FooBar` plugin. To achieve that,
 * several steps should be performed:
 *
 *  1. Define the corresponding extension function upon this scope;
 *  2. Apply and configure the plugin inside that function;
 *  3. Call that function in your `build.gradle.kts` file.
 *
 * Here's an example of `js/plugins/FooBar.kt`:
 *
 * ```
 * fun JsPlugins.fooBar() {
 *     plugins.apply("com.fooBar")
 *     extensions.configure<FooBarExtension> {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * And how to apply this in `build.gradle.kts`:
 *
 *  ```
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.js.javascript
 * import io.spine.internal.gradle.js.plugins.fooBar
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * javascript {
 *     plugins {
 *         fooBar()
 *     }
 * }
 *  ```
