# Integration tests

This package contains modules for testing of the unpublished `spine-web` NPM library against
the Spine-based server. The `test-app` module contains a simplified Spine application.
The `web-tests` module defines tests acting as a client-side application where client-server
interactions are carried out by `spine-web` NPM library.

## `test-app`

The `test-app` module contains a simplified Spine application. The `web-tests` module uses this
application as a test backend. The application uses the Spine `web` API (with the `firebase-web`
library). The application model contains a minimal set of commands, events, and projections that
allows to test functionality of the `spine-web` library.

The application uses Firebase application emulated locally with a [`firebase-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-server)
tool. This tool is executed from the `web-tests` module `node_modules` folder.

### Running the application locally

The application can be run locally by Gretty and Firebase emulators. To run the
application do the following:

1. Add a Google Cloud service account key to the `src/main/resources` directory. The file should be
called `spine-dev.json` and be a valid service account credential. It, however, must not have any
permissions, as it is never used for remote calls, but only to satisfy requirements of
the Firebase Admin SDK. 

2. Assemble the application:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean assemble
    ```
    
3. Start the local server:

    The following command runs the server on `localhost:8080`. It also runs
    the the local Firebase server on `localhost:5000`:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew appStart
    ```

After the command is executed, the server is available on `localhost:8080`.
To debug the local server, create a new Remote configuration and run it in the debug mode.
The configuration should connect to `localhost:5005`.

### Stopping the application
 
The local server should be stopped with `./gradlew appStop` command or just by terminating a
console process. When stopping the local server with a respective command, server and
Firebase emulators are stopped. When terminating a console process, Firebase emulator stays serving.

## `web-tests`

The `web-tests` module performs tests of the unpublished artifact of the `spine-web` library. It
defines tests acting as a client-side application that uses `spine-web` library for interactions
with a backend.

Performs tests using the unpublished artifact of the `spine-web` library. This approach allows to
test not only the library functionality but also ensure it is properly built.

### Running integration test

To run the integration tests do the following:
1. Assemble the application:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean assemble
    ```
    
2. Run tests:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew web-tests:integrationTest
    ```
    This command does the following:
     - installs the unpublished artifact of the `spine-web` library form the `client-js` module 
       as module NPM dependency by call to `npm link spine-web` command. For details about
       two-step package linking see `npm-link` [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link);
     - runs the local backend server from the `test-app` module;
     - performs integration tests;
     - stops the local server when test complete or fail.
