 * <p>This bridge stores the {@link QueryResponse} data to a location in a given Firebase database
 * and retrieves the database path to that response as the result.
 *
 * <p>More formally, for each encountered {@link Query}, the bridge performs a call to
 * the {@code QueryService} and stores the resulting entity states into the given database. The data
 * is stored as a list of strings. Each entry is
 * a {@linkplain io.spine.json.Json JSON representation} of an entity state. The path produced by
 * the bridge as a result is the path to the database node containing all those records.
 * The absolute position of such a node is not specified, thus the result path is the only way
 * to read the data from the database.
