/**
 * A request to post a command to the Spine backend.
 *
 * Optionally allows to subscribe to events that are the immediate results of handling the command.
 *
 * A usage example:
 * ```
 * client.command(logInUser)
 *       .onOk(_logOk)
 *       .onError(_logError)
 *       .onImmediateRejection(_warnAboutRejection)
 *       .observe(UserLoggedIn.class, ({subscribe, unsubscribe}) => {
 *           subscribe(event => _logAndUnsubscribe(event, unsubscribe));
 *           setTimeout(unsubscribe, EVENT_WAIT_TIMEOUT);
 *       })
 *       .observe(UserAlreadyLoggedIn.class, (({subscribe, unsubscribe}) => {
 *           subscribe(event => _warnAboutAndUnsubscribe(event, unsubscribe));
 *           setTimeout(unsubscribe, EVENT_WAIT_TIMEOUT);
 *       })
 *       .post();
 * ```
 *
 * The `subscribe` callback provided to the consumer allows to configure an event receival process
 * while the `unsubscribe` callback allows to cancel the subscription.
 *
 * Please note that in the example above we make sure the subscription is cancelled even if the
 * specified event type is never received.
