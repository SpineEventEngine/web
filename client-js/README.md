# Spine Web JS client library

This module is a JS library that communicates with Spine Web server. Itâ€™s a facade for sending 
domain commands, querying data, and subscribing to entity states. The latest published version can 
be found on [NPM][spine-web-npm].

The NPM artifact provides the following:

* `spine-web` files along with used Protobuf definitions.

* Types from [google-protobuf][protobuf-npm] NPM package.
  These types should be used since they are additionally processed 
  by Spine's Protobuf plugin for JS.
 
* Sources transpiled into ES5 along with their source maps.

It does **not** provide a bundled version assuming that library users perform bundling themselves.

## Testing

Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

You can also run tests from IntelliJ IDEA. To do so:

1. Install [NodeJs Plugin][idea-nodejs]. The plugin adds `Mocha` configuration.

2. Use [`webpack-test.config.js`](./test/webpack-test.config.js) as IDEA Webpack configuration.
   
  This allows IDEA resolve aliases the very same way Babel does for us in tests.

3. Update `Mocha` configuration template:

  * Add `--require @babel/register` to `Extra Mocha options`. 
  
    It is required to support all ES6 features in Node.js environment.
  
  * Specify the path to `Mocha` package: `~\IdeaProjects\Spine\web\client-js\node_modules\mocha`.
