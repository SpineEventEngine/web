/**
 * An {@link HttpServlet} which receives {@linkplain Query query requests} and handles them via
 * a {@link QueryBridge}.
 *
 * <p>The servlet supports only {@code POST} requests. {@code GET}, {@code HEAD}, {@code PUT},
 * {@code DELETE}, {@code OPTIONS}, and {@code TRACE} methods are not supported by default.
 *
 * <p>In order to perform a {@linkplain io.spine.client.Query query}, a client should send an HTTP
 * {@code POST} request to this servlet. The request body should be a {@linkplain io.spine.json.Json
 * JSON} representation of a {@link Query io.spine.client.Query}.
 *
 * <p>If the request is valid (i.e. the request body contains a valid {@link io.spine.client.Query
 * Query}), the response will contain a message with the query result. The format of the result
 * depends on the implementation of {@link QueryBridge}.
 *
 * <p>If the query cannot be parsed from the request, the response will be empty with the response
 * code {@link HttpServletResponse#SC_BAD_REQUEST 400}.
 *
 * <p>A typical implementation would extend this class and provide a {@link QueryBridge} in
 * the constructor. No additional config is required in order for this servlet to handle
 * the {@linkplain io.spine.client.Query entity queries}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code QueryServlet} does not support serialization. Please keep that in mind when selecting
 * a servlet container. When trying to serialize an instance of {@code QueryServlet}, an
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} is thrown.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the query result
